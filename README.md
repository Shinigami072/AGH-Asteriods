#ASTEROIDS

Dependencies:
-----------
- python3
- pygame


main.py is used to start the game

Final thoughts:
1. rendering should be done better - currentlly there is no object oriented abstraction and rendering code is intersected with logic improperly
2. model editor could be a lot more fleshed out, or a already used model format could be used
